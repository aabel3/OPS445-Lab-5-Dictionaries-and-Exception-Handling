# OPS445 Lab 5 – Dictionaries and Exception Handling

Welcome to OPS445 Lab 5!

In this lab, you will continue developing your Python programming skills by learning how to work with dictionaries and handle exceptions. These skills are essential for managing structured data and writing resilient programs that can gracefully recover from errors.

📚 Lab Objectives:
+ Learn how to create and manipulate dictionaries in Python
+ Practice common dictionary operations:
  - Adding and removing key-value pairs
  - Iterating through dictionary items
  - Accessing values safely
+ Understand how to use exception handling with try, except, and finally blocks
+ Combine dictionaries and exception handling to build robust programs
+ Strengthen debugging skills by handling runtime errors effectively

📂 Lab Files:
You will create and work with the following files during this lab:
+ lab5a.py – Basic dictionary creation and manipulation
+ lab5b.py – Iterating through dictionaries
+ lab5c.py – Safe dictionary access with error handling
+ lab5d.py – Exception handling with try/except
+ lab5e.py – Combining dictionaries and exception handling

🧩 Tips & Tricks:
+ Use .get() when accessing dictionary values to avoid KeyError.
+ Remember that dictionary keys must be immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).
+ Use try/except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully.
+ Always test your code with both valid and invalid inputs to ensure robustness.
+ Keep your code modular and well-commented for easier debugging and review.
